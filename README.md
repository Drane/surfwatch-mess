TODO:
=====
* Implement Swagger
* Break into micro services if possible
* Use correlation ID's (e.g. on button click... pass ID through services)
* Centralised logs (Kibana, prometheus...) in own container
* Kubernetes
* Think in ctx of services... a user in 1 ctx <> another ctx, don't pass all data everywhere
